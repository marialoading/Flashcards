# flashCards

Mega-princess-ultra-kawaii-unicorn-pixel-uwu styled flashcard tool. 
Built for exam preperation, powered by cats, pastel gradients and the mighty leitner algorithm.
I also drew this extremely complicated cat portraits which absolutely took more time than coding this. 
You can register and start creating decks, includes study mode with spaced repetition (Leitner system, but cuter~). Future updates may include a switch for real-time leitner and fast-forward.
Feel free to add Decks for learning, it's currently empty.

used Tech-Stack:
Python (look at requirements.txt) for backend
Vue, Typescript, CSS for frontend
I add Docker to everything, so there's that too
Oh and PostgreSQL
