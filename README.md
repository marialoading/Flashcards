    <dt>
       <dt> Built for exam preperation, powered by cats, pastel gradients and the mighty leitner algorithm. </dt>
       <dt> I also drew this extremely complicated cat portraits which absolutely took more time than coding this.  </dt>
       <dt> You can register and start creating decks, includes study mode with spaced repetition (Leitner system, but cuter~) </dt>
       <dt> Future updates may include a switch for real-time leitner and fast-forward. </dt>
       <dt> Feel free to add Decks for learning, it's currently empty. </dt>
